Project Overview

This project focuses on collecting laptop data from Flipkart, cleaning and analyzing the dataset, and building machine learning models to predict laptop prices and cluster similar laptops. The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data analytics and machine learning workflow, including web scraping, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building.
